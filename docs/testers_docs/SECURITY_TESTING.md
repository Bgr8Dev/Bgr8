# üîí Security Testing Guide

## üéØ What is Security Testing?

Security testing ensures the platform protects user data and prevents unauthorized access. This guide covers the main security areas to test.

---

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

**What it does**: Controls who can access what on the platform.

### Key Areas:
- **Login Security**: Invalid credentials rejected, brute force protection
- **Password Security**: Strong passwords required (12+ chars), secure reset
- **Session Security**: Proper timeouts, secure logout, session management
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin portal restricted, role assignments secure
- **Permission Control**: Users can only access their allowed features

### Test Focus:
- Can you login with wrong credentials?
- Are weak passwords rejected?
- Do sessions timeout properly?
- Can non-admins access admin features?
- Are user roles properly enforced?

## üõ°Ô∏è Input Validation & Sanitization

**What it does**: Prevents malicious input from attacking the platform.

### Key Areas:
- **XSS Prevention**: Script injection blocked, output properly encoded
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Database queries protected, parameters secured
- **Input Length Validation**: Length limits enforced, buffer overflows prevented
- **File Upload Security**: File types validated, size limits enforced
- **Content Scanning**: Malicious files blocked, content checked

### Test Focus:
- Can you inject scripts in text fields?
- Are SQL injection attempts blocked?
- Are file uploads properly validated?
- Do input length limits work?
- Are malicious files rejected?

## üîí Data Protection

**What it does**: Protects user data from unauthorized access and exposure.

### Key Areas:
- **Data Encryption**: HTTPS for transit, encryption for storage
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: PII protection, data anonymization
- **User Data Isolation**: Users can't access other users' data
- **Admin Data Access**: Admin access logged and controlled
- **Data Retention**: Proper data deletion and retention policies

### Test Focus:
- Is the site using HTTPS?
- Can users see other users' private data?
- Is admin access properly logged?
- Are sensitive data fields protected?
- Is data properly encrypted?

## üåê Network Security

**What it does**: Protects the platform from network-based attacks.

### Key Areas:
- **API Security**: Authentication required, rate limiting active
- **CORS Configuration**: Cross-origin requests properly controlled
- **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, and other security headers set
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
- **Input Validation**: API parameters properly validated

### Test Focus:
- Can you access APIs without authentication?
- Are rate limits enforced?
- Are security headers present?
- Are cross-origin requests controlled?
- Are API inputs properly validated?

## üîç Vulnerability Testing

**What it does**: Tests for common security vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

### Key Areas:
- **OWASP Top 10**: Tests for the most common web vulnerabilities
- **CSRF Protection**: Prevents cross-site request forgery attacks
- **Clickjacking Protection**: Prevents malicious iframe embedding
- **Business Logic Security**: Ensures workflows can't be bypassed
- **Data Manipulation**: Prevents unauthorized data changes

### Test Focus:
- Are common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10) addressed?
- Is CSRF protection working?
- Can the site be embedded in malicious iframes?
- Can business workflows be bypassed?
- Can data be manipulated inappropriately?

## üì± Mobile Security

**What it does**: Ensures security on mobile devices and apps.

### Key Areas:
- **Mobile Authentication**: Secure login on mobile devices
- **Mobile Data Storage**: Local data encryption and secure storage
- **Mobile Session Management**: Secure session handling on mobile
- **Biometric Security**: Fingerprint/face ID security (if implemented)

### Test Focus:
- Is mobile login secure?
- Is local data encrypted on mobile?
- Are mobile sessions properly managed?
- Do mobile-specific vulnerabilities exist?

## üö® Security Issues to Report

### High Priority
- **Authentication bypass**: Can access without proper login
- **Data exposure**: Can see other users' private data
- **Admin access**: Non-admins can access admin features
- **Script injection**: Can inject malicious scripts
- **File upload issues**: Can upload malicious files

### Medium Priority
- **Weak password policies**: Weak passwords accepted
- **Session issues**: Sessions not properly managed
- **Missing security headers**: Important headers not set
- **CSRF vulnerabilities**: Cross-site request forgery possible
- **Input validation**: Malicious input not properly blocked
