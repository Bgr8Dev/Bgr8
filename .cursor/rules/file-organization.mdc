# File Organization Rules

## Project Overview
This is a React TypeScript application for the Bgr8 mentoring platform, built with Vite, Firebase, and modern web technologies.

## Directory Structure Rules

### Python Scripts
- ALL Python scripts (.py files) MUST be placed in the `scripts/` directory
- Use descriptive names for scripts (e.g., `fix-release-links.py`, `smart-changelog.py`)
- Include proper documentation and error handling in Python scripts
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code

### Documentation
- ALL documentation files (.md files) MUST be placed in the `docs/` directory
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Follow markdown best practices
- Include proper headings and structure
- For testing documentation, use the `docs/testers_docs/` subdirectory

### Code Files
- ALL application code MUST be written in TypeScript (.ts/.tsx files) and CSS (.css files)
- NO JavaScript files (.js) should be created for new features
- Use proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Follow the existing component structure in `src/components/`

## File Organization Patterns

### Components
- Components go in `src/components/` with appropriate subdirectories
- Use the existing component structure and naming conventions
- Each component should have its own directory when complex

### Pages
- Pages go in `src/pages/` with appropriate subdirectories
- Follow the existing page structure patterns
- Group related pages in subdirectories (e.g., `authPages/`, `adminPages/`)

### Utilities and Services
- Utilities go in `src/utils/` or `src/services/`
- Use clear, descriptive names for utility functions
- Group related utilities in appropriate files

### Types
- Types go in `src/types/`
- Create separate files for different type categories
- Use proper TypeScript interface definitions

### Styles
- Styles go in `src/styles/`
- Use component-specific CSS files when needed
- Follow the existing CSS file naming convention

## Import/Export Standards

### Import Organization
- Group imports: React imports first, then third-party, then local imports
- Use absolute imports when possible (configured in tsconfig.json)
- Keep imports clean and organized

### Export Patterns
- Use named exports for components and utilities
- Use default exports for main page components
- Export types and interfaces appropriately

## Forbidden File Practices

- DO NOT create JavaScript (.js) files for new features
- DO NOT place Python scripts outside the `scripts/` directory
- DO NOT place documentation outside the `docs/` directory
- DO NOT create files without proper organization structure
- DO NOT bypass the established directory patterns
