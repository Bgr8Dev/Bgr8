> 🛡️ At Bgr8 Platform, we take security seriously. This document outlines our security procedures and policies.

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly**
2. **Email us at [security@bgr8.com](mailto:security@bgr8.com)**
3. **Include detailed information about the vulnerability**
4. **We will respond within 48 hours**

### What to Include in Your Report

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have suggestions for fixing the issue
- **Contact Information**: Your preferred method of contact

## 🔒 Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Firebase Authentication with secure token management
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC) with admin/user roles
- ❌ Multi-factor authentication support (planned for future release)
- ✅ Session management with secure timeouts (30 minutes)
- ✅ Rate limiting on authentication attempts (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- ✅ Strong password requirements (12+ characters with complexity)

### Data Protection
- ✅ All data encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS 1.3)
- ✅ Sensitive data encrypted at rest (Firebase Firestore)
- ⚠️ Regular security audits and penetration testing (automated only)
- ⚠️ GDPR compliance measures (basic implementation)

### Application Security
- ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation with nonce-based security
- ✅ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection via input sanitization
- ✅ Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection via same-origin policy
- ✅ SQL injection prevention (NoSQL database with parameterized queries)
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization with regex patterns
- ✅ Request size limiting (10KB max)
- ✅ CORS protection with allowed origins

### Infrastructure Security
- ⚠️ Regular security updates and patches (manual process)
- ⚠️ Firewall protection (hosting provider dependent)
- ⚠️ DDoS mitigation (hosting provider dependent)
- ✅ Secure hosting environment (Firebase hosting)

## 🛠️ Security Headers

Our application implements the following security headers (verified in `index.html` and `src/middleware/security.ts`):

```

## 🔍 Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- ✅ Static code analysis with ESLint security rules (`.eslintrc.security.cjs`)
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability scanning with npm audit (`npm run security:audit`)
- ✅ Snyk vulnerability scanning (`npm run security:snyk`)
- ✅ Comprehensive security linting (`npm run security:lint`)
- ❌ Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline (not implemented)
- ❌ Regular penetration testing (manual process only)

### Manual Testing
- ⚠️ Security code reviews (ad-hoc basis)
- ❌ Manual penetration testing (not regularly scheduled)
- ⚠️ Security architecture reviews (basic implementation)
- ❌ Third-party security audits (not conducted)

## 📋 Security Checklist

### Development
- ✅ All inputs validated and sanitized (regex patterns, length limits)
- ✅ Authentication implemented correctly (Firebase Auth)
- ✅ Authorization checks in place (RBAC with admin/user roles)
- ✅ Sensitive data encrypted (Firebase Firestore encryption)
- ✅ Security headers configured (comprehensive CSP and security headers)
- ✅ Error handling doesn't leak information (generic error messages)

### Deployment
- ✅ HTTPS enabled (Firebase hosting with automatic SSL)
- ✅ Security headers set (via meta tags and middleware)
- ✅ Environment variables secured (Firebase config)
- ✅ Database access restricted (Firestore security rules)
- ⚠️ Logging configured (basic Firebase analytics)
- ⚠️ Monitoring in place (Firebase performance monitoring)

## 🚀 Security Updates

Current security update schedule:

- **As needed**: Security dependency updates (manual process)
- **Ad-hoc**: Security architecture review (when issues arise)
- **Planned**: Annual security audit (not yet implemented)
- **Immediate**: Security patches and updates (when vulnerabilities found)
